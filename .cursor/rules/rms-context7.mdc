description: Always use Context7 MCP with library ID "/praveenaj/rms-docs-md" for RMS API prompts
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---

- Whenever a prompt mentions "RMS" or "RMS API", automatically use the Context7 MCP tool with the library ID `/praveenaj/rms-docs-md`.
- Do not require the user to specify the library ID manually in the prompt.
- Prioritize this behavior for all API-related questions referencing RMS.

# Example
If the user asks "How do I authenticate with the RMS API?", include documentation from `/praveenaj/rms-docs-md` via Context7 MCP.
